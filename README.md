Scratched Dice, a dice game...

This script uses animation and random numbers to simulate a game of dice.
It accepts bets, rolls two dice, assigns a random outcome to each die, calculates and displays probabilites, determines pay-outs, and keeps count of the numbers of games played and the amount of money won or lost.

The pay-out rules are as follows:

A sum of 2 or 12 pays 3 times the current bet.

A sum of 3 or 11 pays 2 times the current bet.

A sum of 4 or 10 pays 1 times the current bet.

Requirements:

To implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

    Must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
    Must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
    Must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
    Must use at least one sound.

The project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, the project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
